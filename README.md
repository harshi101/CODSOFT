Titanic Survival Prediction - CODSOFT Internship

This project is a part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship (Task 1).  
We use the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

Objective
To build a binary classification model using logistic regression that can predict passenger survival based on attributes like age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

Steps Followed

1. Data Cleaning (handled missing values)
2. Feature Encoding (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
3. Dropped irrelevant columns (`Name`, `Cabin`, `Ticket`)
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training using Logistic Regression
6. Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

Model Accuracy
Accuracy Achieved: ~72%

Confusion Matrix and F1-score indicate good performance on non-survivors.
